# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

To Do:
* make files: yes

* use Krishna's suggestions for quiz questions and answers

* use "contact page" from Unit 4 Day 2 @22:45 in video for entering name for Highest Score

* use local storage to diplay Highest Scores

* Use count-down timer for the quiz timer

* use Bootstrap for layout? 

* use event.preventDefault(); at top of JS ? Maybe if using objects.
