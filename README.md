# Code Quiz

Coding Quiz that provides five questions with multiple choice answers. Play the game and see if you can beat the clock. Click on one of the four multiple choice answers provided to answer the quiz. Be careful though as there is a 15 point penalty for each wrong choice. 

Note: 
*  Countdown timer starts at 75 and starts counting down to zero when the quiz is started. 
* Quiz is over when players choses answers for all questions (at present there are five but this is easily examplable and also interchangeable with quizzes on other topics). Or quiz is also over when the clock reaches zero.
*  The sooner the player finished the quiz, the higher the score; your score is derived from the time remaining. 

Still to be implemented:
* Have saved player's score to local storage. Next step will be to post it on the high scores page and keep adding to the scoreboard with each round of the game.
